## üöÄ Project Description <a name="pdescription"></a>
This project aims to show all the knowledge acquired in the 5 courses that make up the "Applied Data Science with Python" specialization. The knowledge is projected in all the exercises performed. All exercises are for work purposes, respecting the honor code presented by Coursera.
The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

Introduction to Data Science in Python (course 1), Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (course 2), and Applied Machine Learning in Python (course 3) should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization.  After completing those, courses 4 and 5 can be taken in any order.  All 5 are required to earn a certificate.
## üíª Software Description <a name="sdescription"></a>
All exercises were done on jupyter notebooks, since this is the format presented by Coursera. In addition, the use of Markdown and coded cells is facilitated.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Data Science in Python <a name="1"></a>
This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 

This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.
